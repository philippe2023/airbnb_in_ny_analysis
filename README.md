# Project overview
Airbnb is a popular web platform where you can easily find and rent rooms/ apartments and homes for specific amount of time. We decided to analyse the data for the city of New York in 2019 to get some insights and learn more of this market.

# Questions 

Price: 
- What factors influence the pricing of Airbnb listings in NYC?

Occupancy Analysis: 
- Which neighborhoods have the highest and lowest occupancy rates? 
- private rooms are less often available?
- What is the correlation between Prices and length of stay?
Reviews: 
- How do reviews affect the cost of an apartment/house?

# Dataset

# Hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1: Listings in Manhattan are generally more expensive than those in other neighborhoods.
Hypothesis 2: Entire home/apt listings have higher prices than private or shared rooms.
Hypothesis 3: Homes with the most/best reviews are more expensive. 
Hypothesis 4: Prices are affected by length of stay. 

# Conclusions
The project proved how data analysis support decision making, as one of our initial hypothesis was false.
- Manhattan is indeed the most expensive neighbourhood.
- The number of reviews do not have a direct impact of the price
- The longer the length of stay is, the lower will be the price.
- The availability of shared rooms is greater than full listings and whole listings have higher prices than private listings.
